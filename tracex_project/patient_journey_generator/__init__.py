"""
Provide the django app "patient_journey_generator" for the project.

This app is responsible for generating artificial patient journeys. These patient journeys are called "synthetic"
patient journeys and can be used for testing purposes as well as if you have no real-world patient journey at hand.
However, due to the patient journey being synthetic, it does not accurately reflect real-world data.

Modules:
apps -- App configuration for the patient journey generator app.
forms -- Implementation of forms for the patient journey generator app.
generator -- Implementation of the patient journey generator.
urls -- URL configuration for the patient journey generator app.
views -- Implementation of views for the patient journey generator app.
